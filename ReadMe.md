# Chatroom

The following is a class project for a web-development class in which we created a chatroom in which users can sign in to chat with other users. In this project, we implemented node.js. Following is a description of the class project. The "Creative Portion" is a portion of points that are dedicated to the level of difficulty with which we implemented features that were not required by the rubric. 

Creative Portion:
Users can choose the color of the message they would like to send using a color spectrum. Instead of making it so that the entire conversation's messages are the color they chose and only they can see it, we made it so that only that message is the chosen color and all other people in the conversation can also see the message in that color. 

Another creative thing we implemented is being able to see the entire chat log when you enter it. At first, when a user joins a room, they can only see the messages starting from the moment they enter a room. Now, the new user can see the messages starting from the creation of the chatroom. 

We also did a lot on user interactions. For example, a user can press enter to send a message or press the "send" button. Users can also log out, which disconnects them from all the rooms. It also hides the interface so that they cannot enter a chatroom. But, if they decide to log back in, they have to refresh the page and enter a username (either old username or new username).


Tips:
Join chatroom: double click chatroom name
Ban/kick user (admin of chatroom): double click user name on user message, past history log in chatroom 
Private message to user (anybody): double click user name on user message, past history log in chatroom

*Unfortunately, due to the age of this class project, the code is no longer being hosted on an amazon server.*
